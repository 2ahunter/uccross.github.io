## [Popper](https://github.com/systemslab/popper)

[Popper](https://github.com/systemslab/popper) is a container-native 
workflow execution engine. This is a list of technical writing 
projects:

| **Title**       | Improve presentation of underlying concepts   |
| **Mentor(s)**   | [Ivo Jimenez](http://www.ivotron.me)          |
| **Description** | Provide introductory material that serves as an overview to the different concepts and technologies involved in executing container-native workflows: Operating System (Linux), Language Runtimes (e.g. Python), Containers (Docker, Singularity), Resource Managers (Kubernetes, SLURM). The goal being to explain clearly what Popper does and what can users accomplish by using it. Currently, the documentation assumes expertise in all those topics but we would like to lower the entry barrier for new users. |

| **Title**       | Port wiki to ReadTheDocs or other documentation platform |
| **Mentor(s)**   | [Jeff LeFevre](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~jlefevre)          |
| **Description** | Skyhook's documentation is currently written as Github Wiki pages. We would like to move it to another platform such as <https://readthedocs.org>, to reorganize it and rewrite some sections as part of this effort. |
