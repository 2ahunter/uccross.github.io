      <small class="pull-right">August 17, 2016</small>
    </h2>

    <p>GridDyn is a power system simulator developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The name is a concatenation of Grid Dynamics, and as such usually pronounced as “Grid Dine”. It was created to meet a research need for exploring coupling between transmission, distribution, and communications system simulations.</p>

<p>While good open source tools existed on the distribution side,  the open source tools on the transmission side were limited in usability either in the language or platform or simulation capability, and commercial tools, while quite capable, simply did not allow the access to the internal components and data required to conduct the research. Thus, the decision was made to design a platform that met the needs of the research project. Building off of prior efforts in grid simulation, GridDyn was designed to meet the current and future research needs of the various power grid related research and computational efforts.</p>

<p>It is written in C++, making use of recent improvements in the C++ standards.  It is intended to be cross platform with regard to operating system and machine scale. The design goals were for the software to be easy to couple with other simulation, and be easy to modify and extend.  It is very much still in development and as such, the interfaces and code is likely to change, in some cases significantly as more experience and testing is done. It is our expectation that the performance, reliability, capabilities, and flexibility will continue to improve as projects making use of the code continue and new ones develop.  We expect there are still many issues so any bug reports or fixes are welcome. And hopefully even in its current state and as the software improves the broader power systems research community will find it useful.</p>

<p>GridDyn is Open Source software, publicly available on GitHub at: <a href="https://github.com/llnl/griddyn">github.com/llnl/griddyn</a> under a <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/GridDyn/blob/master/LICENSE">BSD License</a>.</p>

      <a href="/news/2016/03/09/visit-2.10.1/">VisIt 2.10.1 Released</a>
      <small class="pull-right">March 09, 2016</small>
    </h2>

    <p>Source code and prebuilt executables are available on the <a href="https://visit.llnl.gov/">VisIt web site</a>.</p>

<p>VisIt 2.10.1 contains the following enhancements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>VisIt now permits the -socket-bridge-host command line argument to override the host name passed to compute engines when VCL starts a socket bridge. This is useful for login nodes that are attached to multiple network interfaces such as on BlueGene/Q where compute nodes may need to attach to the socket bridge host (typically the LAC node) using an alias.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The PF3D database plugin was enhanced so that it reads the new multi level file format.</li>
  <li>The SPH Resample Operator now supports zone-centered data.</li>
  <li>VTK’s higher order elements are now exposed via Libsim.</li>
  <li>The Silo database plugin now supports all-empty multi-block objects.</li>
  <li>The interpretation of “_meshtv_searchpath” and “_visit_searchpath” was changed in the Silo database plugin. If the search path is blank it will now be ignored instead of causing the plugin to ignore all variables located in subdirectories. The plugin will now ignore all variables located in subdirectories when the search path contains a path that doesn’t exist in the Silo file. This change in behavior was necessitated when we discovered that codes had been unintentionally outputting Silo files with blank search paths for years. Because the Silo plugin wasn’t handling a blank search path properly, this never caused a problem. When the behavior was fixed in VisIt 2.10, VisIt no longer displayed the variables in the subdirectories in its menus when it encountered such a file. Since we couldn’t fix all the existing files, we decided to change the interpretation of the search path in VisIt.</li>
  <li>The pre-built Ubuntu distributions now contain support for reading ITAPS files.</li>
  <li>The PDB Z File database plugin was enhanced to support marker meshes and variables.</li>
  <li>The MFEM database plugin was updated to use MFEM 3.1, which provides support for MFEM AMR meshes. See http://mfem.org/ for more details.</li>
  <li>The ADIOS database plugin was upgraded to use ADIOS 1.9.0.</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as the following bug fixes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The VisItAddPlot() function in Libsim was incorrectly using the global “Apply operators to all plots” setting when creating plots. The behavior for VisItAddPlot() has been changed so new plots are not created with previously applied operators to more closely match the operation of the VisIt CLI.</li>
  <li>Large tecplot files can now be read on Windows.</li>
  <li>A potential memory overwrite was fixed in the Fortran visitgetenv function in Libsim.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the QT4 include and archive files were missing after doing a ‘make install’.</li>
  <li>Re-enabled adaptive csg discretization for Windows, which was inadvertently disabled for previous release.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with the PF3D database plugin where the time and cycle were reported as zero for all the time states accessed after the initial time state accessed.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug preventing the reading of DOS-formatted .visit files on Linux.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug whereby setting ‘ssh command’ would not work correctly on Windows. If the path to ssh contains spaces, the full path and command need to be surrounded in double-quotes, eg “C:\Program Files (x86)\Putty\plink.exe”. If manually adding this to an .xml host profile, the quotes and path-separators should be escaped: “"C:\Program Files (x86)\Putty\plink.exe"”.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug opening Silo files larger than 4 Gbytes on Windows.</li>
  <li>Fixed the tensorVectorMult bug in the SPH Resample Operator found by Cody Raskin.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that prevented the SPH Resample Operator from working with the Volume Plot.</li>
  <li>Fixed handling of buggy mmesh_name member of multi-block objects in Silo files.</li>
</ul>

      <a href="/news/2016/02/16/mfem-3.1/">MFEM 3.1 Released</a>
      <small class="pull-right">February 16, 2016</small>
    </h2>

    <p>Version 3.1 of MFEM, a lightweight, general, scalable C++ library for finite element methods, is now available at: <a href="http://mfem.org">http://mfem.org</a></p>

<p>The goal of MFEM is to enable research and development of scalable finite element discretization and solver algorithms through general finite element abstractions, accurate and flexible visualization, and tight integration with the hypre linear solvers library. It has many features, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2D and 3D, arbitrary high-order H1, H(curl), H(div), L2 and NURBS elements.</li>
  <li>Parallel version scalable to hundreds of thousands of MPI cores.</li>
  <li>Conforming or nonconforming adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), including anisotropic refinement.</li>
  <li>Galerkin, mixed, isogeometric, DG and DPG discretizations.</li>
  <li>Support for triangular, quadrilateral, tetrahedral and hexahedral elements with curved boundaries.</li>
  <li>Lightweight interactive OpenGL visualization with <a href="http://glvis.org">GLVis</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the new additions in version 3.1 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Substantially improved non-conforming adaptive mesh refinement, which now works also in parallel.</li>
  <li>General finite element spaces and solvers on surfaces and mesh skeletons.</li>
  <li>Support for hybridization and static condensation, with a new FEM &lt;-&gt; linear system interface.</li>
  <li>New eigensolvers and improved linear solvers and preconditioners.</li>
  <li>Visualization of non-conforming meshes and grid functions, and vector fields on surface meshes.</li>
  <li>Six new examples codes for parallel AMR, eigenvalue problems and DG diffusion.</li>
  <li>Five new electromagnetic and meshing miniapps.</li>
</ul>

<p>MFEM is freely available under LGPL 2.1.</p>
