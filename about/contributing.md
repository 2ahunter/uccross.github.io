LLNL welcomes contributions from the general public to our [open source projects on GitHub](https://github.com/llnl). Each of the projects maintains an [issue tracker](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) and is capable of accepting [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) from other users.

### Contributing

Refer to individual projects for their requirements on accepting contributions. In general though, we follow the "fork and pull" Git workflow model:

* Fork a repository
* Develop your changes in your fork
* Create a pull request to the "upstream" repository
* If approved, changes will be merged in by a repository maintainer

### Employees

If you are an LLNL employee and you are interested in joining the [LLNL GitHub organization](https://github.com/llnl) and appearing in the [member list](https://github.com/orgs/LLNL/people), do the following:

* [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
    * This can be anything you like, e.g. `JohnDoe`, as this is your personal GitHub username
* [Upload a profile picture](https://help.github.com/articles/how-do-i-set-up-my-profile-picture/) to identify yourself to the community
* Using your `@llnl.gov` email address, send a message to [the GitHub organization admins](mailto:github-admin@llnl.gov) to requesting to join the GitHub organization
* After receiving the invitation via email, and accepting it, please set your [organization visibility](https://help.github.com/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership/) to `Public`, so that everyone can know that you're a member
