## [Popper](https://github.com/systemslab/popper)

Popper is a workflow execution engine based on [Github 
actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (GHA). Popper workflows 
are defined in a [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) syntax and 
behave like GHA workflows. The main difference is that a Popper 
workflow can execute actions in other runtimes besides Docker. The 
workflow language is strictly a superset of GHA's workflow language so 
Popper can run a GHA workflow locally.

| **Title**       | Automate Popper Compliance Verification
| **Mentor(s)**   | [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me)
| **Skills**      | Python (strong), Bash (familiar)
| **Description** | An experimentation pipeline is Popper compliant if it complies with all the criteria define in [this document](https://zenodo.org/record/1422203/files/paper.pdf?download=1). For this project, we will implement a process to automatically verify that a pipeline is Popper compliant.

| **Title**       | Actions Library
| **Mentor(s)**   | [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me)
| **Skills**      | Python (strong), Bash (familiar), REST (familiar)
| **Description** | The goal of this project is to create a catalog of re-usable actions used in the creation of experimentation pipelines. For example: a Zenodo action that downloads a dataset to be consumed by a later stage in a pipeline; a Spack action that installs the software stack required for an exploration. This has a list of endless possibilities.

| **Title**       | Popper 2.0
| **Mentor(s)**   | [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me)
| **Skills**      | Python (strong), Github Actions and HCL (familiar)
| **Description** | The goal of this project is to create a workflow execution engine based on Github actions (GHA). With this new approach, Popper workflows will be defined in a syntax similar to HCL and behave like GHA but with the difference that a workflow will be able to execute actions in other runtimes besides Docker. The workflow language is strictly a superset of GHA's workflow language so Popper can run a GHA workflow locally.

| **Title**       | Popper Pipeline and Stages Viewer
| **Mentor(s)**   | [Ivo Jimenez](https://ivotron.me)
| **Skills**      | GUI development (strong), Javascript (strong)
| **Description** | Create a javascript-based viewer of Popper pipelines that allows users to visually explore a pipeline and its contents (similar to [Github's built-in](https://github.com/actions/gcloud/blob/master/.github/main.workflow) workflow editor). As part of this project, a stage catalog will also be implemented, that allows users to search for available stages on Github.

| **Title**       | LGraph and FIRRTL Bidirectional Bridge
| **Mentor(s)**   | Jose Renau (https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~renau/)
| **Skills**      | C++
| **Description** | FIRRTL (https://github.com/freechipsproject/firrtl) is the also open source infrastructure as "a platform for writing circuit-level transformations.". Both FIRRTL and LGraph share many common goals.  Creating a bridge between them allows to leverage features only existing in each one. There are many differences, for example LGraph has ABC synthesis integration and FIRRTL has CHISEL support.  The goal of this project is to implement at C++17 import/export for LGraph that handles FIRRTL.

| **Title**       | LGraph AWS Integration
| **Mentor(s)**   | Jose Renau (https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~renau/)
| **Skills**      | C++/Verilog
| **Description** | The goal of this project is to setup a flow in AWS F1 instances to use LGraph for synthesis. LGraph can read Verilog and synthesize with ABC designs for Xilinx FPGAs. The end goal is to create an open source alternative to the Vivado flow used by AWS F1 instances. Since the open source tools are still not ready to handle place and route in AWS F1, for this project, the place and route will use Vivado, but the tools will be hidden behind LGraph.  Future projects could target to replace these missing pieces while having a working system.

## [Skyhook: programmable storage for databases](http://www.skyhookdm.com)
Skyhook extends object storage in the cloud with data management functionality. Skyhook [formats](https://github.com/uccross/skyhook-ceph/wiki/Data-format-(flatbuffers)) database table partitions as [Flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/), and stores each partition as an object in [Ceph](https://ceph.com) distributed storage. Ceph object classes mechanism allow users to define custom read/write methods for objects.  We have developed methods (C++) for data management including data processing and indexing.

| **Title**       | Database statistics collection on partitioned data
| **Mentor(s)**   | [Jeff LeFevre](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/jlefevre)
| **Skills**      | C++
| **Description** | This project will develop object-class methods to compute data statistics (histograms) for each object and store them in a query-able format within each storage serverâ€™s local RocksDB, then write client code to accumulate all the object-local statistics into global statistics for a given database table.

| **Title**       | Extend current aggregations to include sort/groupby for database partitions
| **Mentor(s)**   | [Jeff LeFevre](https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/people/jlefevre)
| **Skills**      | C++
| **Description** | We have developed methods (C++) for data management including data processing and indexing. This project will develop object-class methods methods to sort/group query result sets.  This requires extending the current code (select/project/basic-aggregations - min/max/sum/count) to support groupby and/or orderby.

## [Tracery and Chancery](https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery)

Two little-languages and libraries for doing text expansion (used in 10,000 twitterbots, plus games and art projects) and state-based chatbots 

|                 |                                               |

| **Title**       | Language and tutorial support for Tracery
| **Mentor(s)**   | [Kate Compton](http://www.galaxykate.com)
| **Skills**      | Javascript (low), Markdown (good), Language fluency and understanding of some non-English culture
| **Description** | In my [guide to supporting opensource art tools](https://github.com/galaxykate/OSSTA-Zine), I argued that art tools need contributors with different languages and cultures to translate the tools to enable access.  This project seeks someone with expert fluency in a non-English language to write javascript "modifiers" functions for Tracery, custom to that language. In English Tracery, these are things like pluralizing words or adding "a/an" to a word). I would like to enable this support for some non-English language, as well as get culturally-relevant Tracery/twitterbot tutorials written in that language.

| **Title**       | Pathfinding for Chancery
| **Mentor(s)**   | [Kate Compton](http://www.galaxykate.com)
| **Skills**      | Javascript (high), graph analysis, pathfinding and traversal
| **Description** | Chancery is a state-based chatbot language (think Twine, but for the Alexa). Users write state machines that represent conversations or games. This project will build a pathfinding algorithm than can calculate which state exits or states cannot be reached (e.g., requiring 5 gems to move from one state to another, but only 4 gems can be collected). If interested, this project could also include building a visualization of that connectivity map.
